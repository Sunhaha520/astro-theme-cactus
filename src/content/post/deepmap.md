## Why Patch Holes
In the process of 3D point cloud reconstruction of buildings, patching holes in wall point clouds is essential to ensure data integrity, enhance the accuracy and quality of building reconstruction, improve visualization effects, ensure the accuracy of analysis and calculations, and increase the efficiency of data processing. Holes can lead to incomplete data, affecting the overall accuracy of analysis, reducing the precision of reconstruction results, damaging the appearance of the model, and increasing the complexity and time cost of data processing. Therefore, patching these holes is necessary to ensure the integrity of point cloud data and the smooth progress of subsequent operations.
## My thoughts
We are aware that point clouds can be converted into depth maps, and depth maps can be converted into point clouds.
